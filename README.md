Welcome to Kieran's SaaS Landing. This is a fictional landing page built as a personal project for my portfolio. I wanted to first create a design using Figma before building out the code myself.

The focus would be to create a modern design and ensure the site was responive, accessible and performant.

## Deployment

Live site is available here [kieran-sass-landing.netlify.app](https://kieran-sass-landing.netlify.app/)

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JS (not required)
- Snowpack 3.2.2
- PostCSS 8.2.9

## Lessons Learned

The main takeaway from this project is how I was able to be a much more productive developer when working from a design. I usually end up iterating designs in the browser which leads to much wasted time.

This time however I designed my first page using Figma and was surprised at how quickly I could come up with a good looking design. Going forward I will designing any personal projects before starting with the code.

## Roadmap

- Fill out some of the whitespace in the features section

- No current plans to build out the rest of the site.
